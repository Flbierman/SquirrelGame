# Unity Squirrels Game

Welcome to the Unity Squirrels Game repository! This repository contains all the assets, packages, project settings, and UI 
elements schema files necessary to play Squirrels in Unity.

## Overview

Remember the nostalgia of childhood games like Frogger? Step into the whimsical world of Squirrels! In this delightful 
adventure, you take on the role of a courageous squirrel (and perhaps a few of its furry friends) as they navigate the 
bustling streets of the city in their quest for survival and, of course, tasty acorns! As you dart across busy streets and 
navigate treacherous alleyways, your agility will be tested. Dodge speeding cars and evade the jaws of 
unfriendly neighborhood dogs who are all too eager to ruin your acorn gathering fun. Along the way, you'll have the 
opportunity to collect an array of upgrades that will aid you in your journey. So, dust off your nostalgia and get 
ready to embark on an unforgettable adventure through the concrete jungle. The city awaits, and it's time to show everyone 
just how resilient and resourceful a squirrel can be.
